## Search Algorithms

### Linear Search
* Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare with x with each element of arr[].
* If x matches with an element, return the index
* If x doesn't match with any of elements, return -1.
* Time complexity - O(n).

### Binary Search
* Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array.
* Time complexity - O(Log n).
